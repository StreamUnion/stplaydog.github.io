I grow up in Hengyang, a medium size city in the province of Hunan, China. After 18 years spending with my parents, I had a joyful undergraduate study in Hunan University learing Software Engineering. After that I spend 3 years in Peking University under the supervision of Shiwen Yu for NLP research.
