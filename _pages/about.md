I grow up in Hengyang, a medium size city in the province of Hunan, China. After 18 years spending with my parents, I went out my home town for the first time in my life to Changsha and had a joyful undergraduate study in Hunan University learing Software Engineering. After that I spend 3 years in Peking University under the supervision of Shiwen Yu for NLP research. Then I headed for Atlanta and earned my PhD degree in the area of combinatorial research for bioinformatics and graph analysis. My software engineering career started late at the age of 29, and I get my first job at Oracle in the Bay area working on Golden Gate, a data base replication software. 2 and half years later, I move back to China and live in Hangzhou, and worked in Alibaba Cloud on ODPS -- a big data platform. Now I am trying something new in TRIAS Lab working on a stealth mode project.
